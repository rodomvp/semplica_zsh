## Installation

* Download [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* Move semplica.zsh_theme to ~/.oh_my_zsh/themes
* edit this line in your ~/.zshrc file
     `ZSH_THEME="semplica"`
* BAM!

## NOTE

This was designed for Mac laptops. The battery function will require minor editing for linux or other OS, and of course will not work at all with desktops.
